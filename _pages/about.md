 I am a master's student in the Blockchain Smart IoT Security Laboratory (advised by Prof. Wei Ren) at China University of Geosciences (Wuhan). I will receive my master's degree in Electronic Information in June 2026. Over the past two years, my work has focused on the security of blockchain applications and AI-driven systems, which has led to one paper under review and another under revision.
